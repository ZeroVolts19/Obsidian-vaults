## Short Bio
Genetic-research-scientist family-man, who you can find on a given day: single-handedly fitting the thick bit of a tree into the back of a Toyota Corolla, eating an entire stick of pepperoni while watching youtube advertisements for products that don't exist, and leaving the kitchen cabinets open. Most importantly though, he's my Dad, and I love 'em.

## Lore
1. Once, after being lambasted for actively eating moldy cottage cheese. said: "I'll be fine, this mold forms the good kind of proteins." 
2. “If you’re cold go outside and come back in”
