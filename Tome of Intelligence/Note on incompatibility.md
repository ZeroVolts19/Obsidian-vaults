1. Spiritual
	1. I’m a Christian, and believe in God. 
	2. In the car you said you can’t respect someone with Christian beliefs! Which I actually don’t hold against you bc so many people that advertise Christianity are poor examples
2. Sexual 
	1. The thought of hurting and tearing someone if I sneeze during a ride is not a fun prospect - and I think it makes sense for both of us to find someone we’re sexually compatible with!
	2. Literally not either of our faults how our bodies are formed in the aspect!
3. Political
	1. I’m a moderate through and through, I’m never aligned with either party - but more than that I genuinely don’t agree with or believe in identity politics, which it seemed like you do. 
		1. The things I don’t like about identity politics is it’s not actually effective for solving issues, it’s only effective for forming powerful political factions- but the issues don’t get solved because then the groups would cease to have a reason for being, and humans (especially politicians) simply can’t function well in a system that incentivizes perpetuation of issues. 
	2. On that note I actually respect your political participation. I think everyone needs to participate to see change effected.
	
4. Respect and maturity
	1. We both have respect and maturity, and that was a big part in making it fun to get to know you better!
	2. I don’t want to leave NC, I have too many plans and I want to stay close to my brother John and his family.
