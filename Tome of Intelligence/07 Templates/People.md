## Short Bio

Genetic-research-scientist family-man, who you can find on a given day: single-handedly fitting the thick bit of a tree into the back of a Toyota Corolla, eating an entire stick of pepperoni while watching youtube advertisements for products that don't exist, and leaving the kitchen cabinets open. Most importantly though, he's my Dad, and I love 'em. 
## Lore
