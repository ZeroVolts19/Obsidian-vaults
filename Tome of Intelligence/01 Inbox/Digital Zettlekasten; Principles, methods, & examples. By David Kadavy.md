###### Quotes
David Kadavy:

Q1:

	“There’s a great video floating around the web of Steve Jobs, in the 1980s, talking about his vision for personal computers. He says he saw a study illustrating the distances various animals traveled per unit of energy. “The condor,” he says, “used the least energy to move a kilometer. And humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing.” But then the study tested the efficiency of a human on a bicycle. As Jobs recalls, “a human on a bicycle blew the condor away – completely off the top of the charts. And that’s what a computer is to me....it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.” Has the computer fulfilled this promise? Is it a bicycle for the mind? With some of the world’s smartest psychologists and computer scientists employed with the aim of making online media more engaging, computers are often more like bumper cars for the mind. My computer doesn’t always feel like a bicycle for the mind, but it does when I use my Zettelkasten. My digital Zettelkasten allows me to seamlessly engage my thoughts with a high-powered database of the most interesting things I’ve read or thought – things I know I know, but which are just beyond the reach of my consciousness. It’s what productivity consultant Ari Meisel would call an “external brain.” Furthermore, when I create notes in my Zettelkasten, I’m effortlessly able to conjure insights that would have called for more mental energy than I have in the moment. A bicycle turns small efforts into tremendous output. A Zettelkasten – especially a digital one – is a bicycle for the mind.”

Q2:

	“While computers often feel like bumper cars for the mind, it’s not the fault of the computers.”
###### Summary / IMOW
Q1:

It’s been said that **the computer can be equal to a bicycle for the mind**, but has the computer stayed true to this premise? I think **plenty are capable** of it. **However**, they more **often** times prove **to** be **distracting**—rather than an efficient way from A to B. That’s where **the Digital Zettlekasten comes in**. If you **can then** steer the proverbial bumpers of personal computing to **jettison you to** your Zettlekasten instead of reading the Dunkin’ sign fifteen times, you can delve into **your own mind** **and** make progress on learning or writing. Make little bits of **progress on your goals.** 


###### Thought
Q2:

 human nature is to be distractable; not computers to be distractions. Merely a vehicle—they can be a bicycle, or bumper car.

David Kadavy:

Q1:

	“The tiny bites you’ll be consuming happen to be the most interesting things you’ve ever read, or the most compelling thoughts you’ve ever had.”

Q2:
###### Thoughts
Q1:

This **makes sense** at a jump, because it’s me selecting the content purely **based off my** own level of **interest** or desire **to learn**. 

###### IMOW
Q1:

It’s a quick **glance at** the most **thought-provoking things you’ve read** so far, **and your most powerful notions** you’ve thought up.


###### Examples

Q1: 

Well, for example, there’s a great argument against Darwin’s origin of man in this series, [[How to think about the great ideas. By Mortimer J. Adler]], and I would consider my thoughts on that chapter and another on emotions that I find some of the most thought provoking stuff.

###### Quotes
David Kadavy:

Q1: 

	“leverage technology to connect the thoughts on the tip of my brain with things I just know I read about somewhere, but can't think of in the moment. Instead of using my brain power to try to remember things, I'm using it to write better articles, newsletters, and books. I finally found a bicycle for my mind.”

###### Thoughts
Q1:

This sounds similar to what I feel a daily need for, I already feel like it’s paid dividends on just conversation in general.

This method of “Zettlekastening”  me remember the the notion I’m reaching for much faster—if at

###### Quote
David Kadavy, quotes Earnest Hemingway:

	“The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water.”
###### Thoughts
David Kadavy in this book calls this the #icebergprinciple, he also related it to how he read that 75% of the effort of a screenplay goes into the climax; To go along with the quote above. 
###### IMOW
The majority of credit for a great work, is due to efforts, knowledge, and experience you don’t see in the final work.
###### Examples
In a wedding, there’s planning and effort for weeks and months and other sums of time that all lead up to a similar progression and climax, like a screenplay. Or, to say it in another way, the underwater portion of an iceberg is the pre-work, planning, and past experiences. While carrying out the wedding itself is the above-water portion of the iceberg.
