#### Lore
###### How we met
We met at Kristen’s cousins thanks giving party. We walked the streets of NYC talking about anarchist theories about how art drives progress. I added a connection to something I was reading about the origin of man, and how one of the proofs is humanity’s artworks and cultural inheritance. She’s super sweet and beautiful. She also was very supportive of the way I handled the situation that happened when John made it a point to draw a line in the sand with Fiz. 
###### ADHD
She said she used to get into fights in school and then there were a lot of tests that came after a while💀.
