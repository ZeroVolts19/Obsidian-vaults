Standards that are compatible with the [[Machinery Directive]], 


## A harmonized standard (for the Machinery Directive)
is a European technical standard developed by European standardization organizations that, once published in the Official Journal of the EU, provides a voluntary path to presumed conformity with the Machinery Directive's essential health and safety requirements, helping manufacturers demonstrate CE-compliant products for free movement in the EU market. 

## How Harmonized Standards Work
1. Voluntary Application: Manufacturers are not legally required to use these standards, but applying them is the easiest way to demonstrate compliance. 
2. Presumption of Conformity: If a product is designed and manufactured in line with a published harmonized standard, it is presumed that the product meets the relevant essential health and safety requirements of the Machinery Directive. 
3. Official Journal Listing: The reference to the standard is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, which signifies its status as a harmonized standard. 
4. CE Marking: Using harmonized standards helps a manufacturer issue a Declaration of Conformity and apply the CE mark to their product, allowing it to be freely sold within the European Economic Area (EEA). 
   
## Purpose of Harmonized Standards
Ensure Safety: They provide technical details to ensure machinery is designed and built to a high level of safety, protecting workers and other people. 
Facilitate Trade: By providing a common set of technical rules, they remove technical barriers and promote the free movement of machinery within the EU market. 
Support the Directive: They are a key mechanism of the Machinery Directive (now Machinery Regulation), which sets mandatory safety requirements while allowing for the flexible, voluntary application of harmonized standards to meet those requirements.
