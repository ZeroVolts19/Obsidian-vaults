| 2025-12-01 | In order to not be the brickmaker who buys bits of colored glass from the Phoenicians, instead of gemstones - I have to actually talk to someone who knows the business of renting out cabins on Airbnb in North Carolina. |

## Project goal & philosophy

**For the land,** the goal is to have a scenic retreat into nature with land that is enjoyable to spend time on, with mountain views and forest to explore. Additionally, a moving water feature is strongly preferred. Also, a plot compatible with solar and hydro-electric power sources may be worth spending the time of an extended search period.

**For the cabin,** the idea is to aim for an affordable and low maintenance building with sustainable utilities where possible. Since affordability is chief, the cabin will be a modest size and will likely be DIY for many elements of the construction. The goal right now is to choose exciting structure designs, like A-frames, to make the cabin(s) appealing for short term rentals like AirBnB.
