# Better and Worse vs More and Less is more profound than is sounds

The thing to remember about this idea is that that the nature of a #mean is—as I understand it, some threshold between more and less. I often have thought to “try to be better” but that is seemingly an unwise pursuit, as I don’t even have a simple scale to go by—I feel as though it would be more pragmatic to think in terms of more and less reaction, per what the scenario calls for to uphold the person I want to be.
