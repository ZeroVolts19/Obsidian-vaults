### Ch10. 
#### Quote
“Negative evidence is always inconclusive. We can never be sure that the negative evidence is not the result simply of our failures in observation.”
#### Thoughts
I think of first using a logical test, something that can be known, like 2 + 2 =/ 5. **This doesn't tell me what 2+2 actually is**, simply one single sum it's not.
#### IMOW
Knowing what something **isn’t** doesn’t necessarily tell you what it **is**.


Knowing what isn't, compared to what is, holds very little weight. other than when refuting something; one is claiming something **you know isn't**, in **their** **opinion is.**

**Main propositions**
##### How to Think about Emotion
###### Quotes
Q1

	“when we talk about the emotions we are talking about such things as anger, fear, love, joy, and sorrow.”
###### Thoughts
Q1

[[Mortimer J. Adler]] doesn’t say definitely that there’s not other emotions, **he just** listed the **ones he talks about?**

Q2

To an extent this removes the effect of FEELING certain emotions and being ashamed or take it personally that you feel them, as you should not be ashamed of fire feeling too hot - burning, as it’s merely a sensation. Emotions are the same, the body is undergoing a reaction to the stimuli, not solely the mind, and then driving the body to feel.

###### Quotes
Q1

	“But no sooner did his reason turn away from God by disobedience than his lower powers rebelled against his reason and his body became subject to sufferings that counteract the life it receives from the soul.”
